The system classified the query as an equity research request, gathered 48 evidence items from official filings, analyst estimates, industry reports, and market data, then synthesized findings into a structured report.\n\nAll 28 findings were adversarially verified and assigned certainty scores ranging from 55% to 97%. The overall certainty of 81% reflects strong confidence in financial data sourced from SEC filings and official earnings releases, with moderate uncertainty around forward-looking estimates and competitive dynamics.\n\nKey corrections during verification: Two forward-looking revenue estimates were adjusted downward from initial synthesizer outputs to reflect a wider range of analyst forecasts. One competitive positioning claim was softened due to contradicting evidence from AMD's recent product announcements.",
